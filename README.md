# Can's Tea Companion

This is a simple Progressive Web App I wrote to help me keep track of my infusions and have a
timer all in one place.

Right now the functionality is limited and you can only use the suggested times found in [this](https://meileaf.com/resources/pdf/mei-leaf-tea-brewing-guide.pdf)
excellent guideline by Mei Leaf.

Features I hope to add sometime in the coming days:
* Ability to add custom tea sessions
* Ability to override timer value
* Better styling
* Saving user's custom tea sessions in `localStorage`
* Add keybindings


Things that I will do for my own sanity:
* Remove all fluff from the `gatsby` starter template
* Refactor code for cleanliness
